# ComplexSystemSimulation Course Project

The project introduced a variant flammability to each cell to evaluate how burning probability impacts the critical density.
The implementation is based on the MESA project and developed by python 3.8.5

ForestFireWithFlammability.ipynb:  Implementations of agent and model, including visualization and experiments.
Running the notebook block by block can reproduce the project workflow.

The Agent and Model are also implemented in the folder `forest_fire` for the interactive visualization.
To enable the visualization, execute `python run.py`

The folder visualizations holds gif files in the the presentation.
